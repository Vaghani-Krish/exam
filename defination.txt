ChatGPT said:
Okay 👍
I will explain this whole Unit-1 content in Gujarati language, but with
👉 English + Gujlish (Gujarati in English words) together
so you can understand easily.

📊 Data Analytics
English:
Data Analytics means collecting, cleaning, analyzing and visualizing data to get useful information.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Data Analytics etle data collect karvo, clean karvo, analyze karvo ane graph ma show karvo jethi meaningful information male.

Example:
E-commerce data, Bank transaction, Google map, Sports data

📚 NumPy Library
English:
NumPy is used for numerical and mathematical operations on arrays.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
NumPy ek Python library chhe je numbers ane arrays par fast calculation mate use thay chhe.
Python list karta fast hoy chhe.

Use:
Mean, Median, Sum, etc.

🐼 Pandas Library
English:
Pandas is used for data analysis and data manipulation (rows & columns).

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Pandas library table format data (rows-columns) par kaam kare chhe.
CSV, Excel file easily handle kare chhe.
Missing value, duplicate data clean karva ma madad kare chhe.

📈 Matplotlib
English:
Matplotlib is used to create graphs and charts.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Matplotlib thi graph ane chart banavi shakai chhe jethi data visually samaj pade.

Example: Line chart, Bar chart, Histogram

📊 Frequency Distribution
English:
It shows how many times a value appears in data.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Frequency distribution etle ek value ketli vaar repeat thay chhe te batave.

Example:
Marks = 70 → 3 students
Means frequency = 3

📉 Histogram
English:
Histogram shows frequency distribution using bars.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Histogram graph ma marks na range (group) batave
X-axis = Marks
Y-axis = Number of students

Bar height = frequency
Bar width = marks range

🔵 Scatter Plot (Correlation)
English:
Scatter plot shows relationship between two numerical variables.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Scatter plot thi be variables vachche relation samaj pade.
Example: Attendance vs Marks

If attendance vadhe → marks vadhe = positive correlation

📦 Box Plot (Outliers)
English:
Box plot shows data spread and outliers.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Box plot thi minimum, maximum, median ane unusual value (outlier) maly chhe.

Outlier =
Bahut j vadhu ke bahut j ochha value
(baaki data thi alag)

❓ Handling Missing Values
English:
Missing values are empty or NaN values.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Missing value etle data ma value na hoy (NaN).

Handle ways:
✔ Fill with mean
✔ Drop row

🔁 Handling Duplicate Values
English:
Duplicate means same row appears again.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Duplicate etle same student / same data repeat thay.

We can:
✔ Remove duplicates
✔ Keep first
✔ Keep last

📐 Normalization
English:
Normalization scales data to same range.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Normalization etle badha numeric values ne same scale par lavu.

Example:
Marks → 0–100
Attendance → 0–365
Both ne comparable banava normalization use kariye.

🔢 Min-Max Normalization
Formula (English):
(x − min) / (max − min)

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Value ne 0 ane 1 vachche convert karvu ne Min-Max normalization kahe chhe.

After normalization:
0 = minimum
1 = maximum

📏 Z-Score Normalization (Standardization)
Formula:
(x − mean) / std

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Mean ane standard deviation use kari data scale kariye.
Result ma values negative pan hoy shake.

📊 Mean, Median, Mode
Mean (English): Average
Gujarati + Gujlish:
Mean etle total / count

Median: Middle value
Gujarati:
Sort kari ne middle value

Mode: Most repeated value
Gujarati:
Je value vadhu vaar aave

📉 Variance & Standard Deviation
English:
Variance shows how far data is from mean.
Std deviation shows average deviation from mean.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Variance batave ke data mean thi ketlu dur chhe
Std deviation batave ke normally ketlu difference hoy chhe

🔗 Covariance
English:
Shows direction of relationship.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Covariance batave ke
✔ Be variables sathe vadhe chhe ke nahi
Positive → sathe vadhe
Negative → ek vadhe to biju ghate

🔗 Correlation
English:
Shows direction + strength of relationship (-1 to +1)

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Correlation batave ke
✔ Relation ketlu strong chhe
+1 = strong positive
-1 = strong negative
0 = no relation

🧮 GroupBy
English:
GroupBy groups data and applies functions.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
GroupBy etle category wise calculation.

Example:
Average marks per subject
Average attendance per gender

📋 Data Summarization
English:
Summarizing large data into small meaningful data.

Gujarati + Gujlish:
Data summarization etle
large data ne short ane useful form ma convert karvu.

Includes:
Mean, Median, Min, Max, Frequency, GroupBy

🎯 In Short (Gujarati + English mix)
✔ Data Analytics = data collect + clean + analyze + visualize
✔ NumPy = numbers
✔ Pandas = table data
✔ Matplotlib = graphs
✔ Frequency = count
✔ Histogram = frequency graph
✔ Scatter = relationship
✔ Box plot = outliers
✔ Normalization = scale data
✔ Mean/Median/Mode = statistics
✔ Correlation/Covariance = relationship
✔ GroupBy = category wise result

If you want, I can also:
✅ Explain page-wise
✅ Explain only theory
✅ Explain only code
✅ Or make short notes for exam

Just say:
👉 “Explain page-wise”
👉 “Make short notes”
👉 “Explain only normalization”
👉 “Explain in more simple Gujlish”

Which one you want next? 😄
